<P>The physics of this applet are pretty simple -- orbits in a Keplerian (i.e.,
point mass) gravitational potential. For this problem, analytic solutions
exist for the position and velocity of an orbiting object as a function of 
time, given its orbital properties. See the "<A TARGET="_top" HREF="TourMain_Links.html">Links</A>" section for references describing orbital calculations.</P>

<P>We do make a few simplifying assumptions, most notably:</P>
<UL>
<LI>The orbits of the planets are circular (they're close to circular, but not perfectly so).</LI>
<LI>The planets all move in single plane (again, they're close to coplanar in the ecliptic, but not perfectly so).</LI>
</UL>

<P>For Grand Tour, we calculate energy in an admittedly simplistic fashion.
Each time the spacecraft needs to change velocity (to leave a planet, or
to rendezvous with a planet), the energy used is considered simply to be
the difference in the kinetic energy between those two velocities. So there's
energy used each time it leaves a planet (where it needs to be boosted
into a higher orbit) and each time it arrives at a planet (where it needs
to match the planet's orbital speed).</P>
