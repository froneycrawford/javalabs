<P><B>Orbital Motion:</B></P>
<P>There are innumerable textbooks describing orbital motion and
	Keplerian gravitational dynamics. One that I find particularly
	useful is "Orbital Motion" by A.E. Roy, which seems to be out
	of print, but is probably available in the your local library.</P>

<P>NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab has a very good website called the
	<A href="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/basics/">Basics of Space
	Flight</A> which actually has a lot of in-depth material. In
	particular look at sections I.3-I.5 on gravity and orbits.</P>

<P><B>Voyager Missions:</B></P>
<P>The <A HREF="http://vraptor.jpl.nasa.gov/">Voyager Project Homepage</A> at NASA has a lot of interesting information of the Voyager probes, including their current positions.  It contains summaries of the scientific achievements of the Voyagers, as well as dozens of images taken of the outer planets.</P>

<P><B>Gravity Assist Orbits:</B></P>
<P>	Again, real spacecraft often use Gravity Assist orbits to pick
	up speed and complete the mission much faster than a classic
	Hohmann orbit would allow. For more information on Gravity
	Assist orbits, check out 
	<A href="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/basics/bsf4-1.html">this part of
	JPL's Basics of Space Flight</A> which describes these orbits
	in detail (look about halfway down the page...).</P>
