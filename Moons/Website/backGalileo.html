Galileo Galilei
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>
Galileo Galilei (1564-1642) was an Italian astronomer who was the first
to use the newly invented telescope to study celestial objects. He was the
first to see lunar mountains and sunspots, and the first to see Saturn's
rings (although his telescope was not good enough to clearly show them
as rings). He also discovered the fact that the planet Venus shows distinct
"phases" much like the Moon, indicating that Venus must orbit the Sun just
as the Moon orbits the Earth.

<P>
Perhaps Galileo's most famous discovery came when he pointed his telescope
at Jupiter. Aside from seeing the disk of the planet, he also saw four dots
of light accompanying it. Over the course of a few nights, these dots changed
position with respect to Jupiter, which Galileo recognized to mean that
they were moons orbiting the giant planet.

<P>
Galileo's discoveries were very controversial, as they indicated that the
Earth was not the center of the Universe: Venus orbited the Sun, small
moons orbited Jupiter, and thus, he argued, it was more natural to believe
that the Earth itself orbited the Sun. These views conflicted with the
teachings of the Catholic Church; the Church forced Galileo to recant his views
and placed him under house arrest for life. Only in 1992 did the Church
admit its condemnation of Galileo was in error...

<P>
But armed with Galileo's discoveries, and shortly thereafter with the work of
Isaac Newton on the theory of gravity, the stage was set for a more complete
understanding of the laws of planetary motion advanced by Johannes Kepler.
