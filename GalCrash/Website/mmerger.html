<P>
So far we have focused on so-called "major mergers" -- mergers of two
large, roughly equal mass disk galaxies. While these represent some of the 
most spectacular collisions we observe, they are far from the most common.
Because of the shape of the galaxy luminosity function, which rises at fainter
luminosities, encounters more commonly involve a galaxy interacting with a 
small satellite companion. However, it turns out that even these "minor 
mergers" can have a dramatic impact on the evolution of galaxies.  That minor 
mergers occur frequently can be seen from even a casual inspection
of the environment of our own Milky Way. The Milky Way is surrounded by 
fourteen known satellite galaxies, the largest and most massive being the 
Large and Small Magellenic Clouds.

At a galactocentric distance of 50 kpc, 
the Magellenic Clouds are believed to orbit our Galaxy once every 
few billion years. The effect of this interaction is clear: tidal forces from 
the Milky Way have torn a long stream of gas -- the Magellenic Stream -- from
these companions, and it has been argued that some of the younger Milky Way
globular clusters may have been tidally stripped from the Magellenic Clouds.
Recently, the discovery of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy plunging through the
galactic disk on the far side of the Galaxy has given us an 
up-close view of the tidal destruction of a merging dwarf galaxy. A similar
system of companions surrounds the nearby Andromeda Galaxy, including the
bright dwarf elliptical galaxies NGC 205 and M32. Indeed, if models of
structure formation in the Universe are to be believed, all bright
galaxies should have a large number of satellite companions.

Unlike major mergers, where dynamical friction is so efficient that the 
galaxies merge after only a few perigalactic passages, the extreme mass ratio
(> 10:1) of minor mergers ensures that the orbital decay of the satellite's
orbit is slow. For example, it is estimated that the orbit of the Magellenic 
Clouds will decay in another ~ 10 Gyr, giving the Clouds a total 
``survival time'' of ~ 10 orbital periods. Rather than the sudden 
violence of a major merger, these
minor mergers are more properly a relatively slow accretion event, and the
dynamical evolution of these systems is markedly different. In particular,
the tidal field of the host galaxy will act to gradually strip material from
the orbiting companion, such that the merger may not play to completion --
the companion may be totally destroyed before reaching the inner portion
of the host galaxy. Since the tidal radius of a orbiting companion is 
roughly proportional to (rho<SUB>s</SUB>/rho<SUB>G</SUB>)<SUP>1/3</SUP> where rho<SUB>s</SUB> and rho<SUB>G</SUB> 
are the average mass density of the satellite and host galaxy, respectively,
it is the low density, diffuse satellite companions which are preferentially
destroyed as they orbit their host. Low density dwarf irregulars and dwarf
spheroidals will certainly be tidally disrupted at relatively large distances
from their hosts, while compact companions (such as Andromeda's M32) may 
survive the accretion process well into the host.

As the satellite is stripped on its orbit, this stripped material can be 
incorporated into the luminous halo of the main galaxy. Over several orbits,
this stripped material will gradually spread out along the satellite's orbital
path, making a kinematically distinct ``tidal stream'' in the halo. In 1978, 
Leonard Searle and Robert Zinn proposed that rather than forming in a single 
monolithic event, the halo of the Milky Way formed through continual accretion 
of material much like the infall of satellite galaxies. To reproduce 
the observed halo luminosity of the Milky Way (L<SUB>B</SUB> ~ 10<SUP>9</SUP> <I>L<SUB>solar</SUB></I>), the
Milky Way must have accreted on the order of a few hundred small satellites 
during its lifetime to build the halo in this manner. Whether or not such
an evolutionary picture is consistent with the Milky Way's dynamically cold
disk (see below) or with the long dynamical friction timescales involved
remains unclear, but a variety of observations argue that some fraction
of the Milky Way's halo -- and presumably those of other spirals as well --
formed through satellite mergers. Observations of halo stars show the
presence of substructure, moving groups, and possible streams of globular 
clusters and dwarf galaxies in the halo. The presence of young A stars in
the otherwise-old halo also argues for recent accretion events, while
tidally stripped material from the Sagittarius dwarf extending out more than 
30<SUP>o</SUP> from the core demonstrate explicitly how satellite accretion can 
feed the Galactic halo.

If the satellite is sufficiently dense and massive, its accretion can do more 
than simply build up the stellar halo of a galaxy. Such satellites more readily 
survive into the inner galaxy; once there, they can strongly influence the
dynamical evolution of the disk. A N-body simulation of such an accretion event
is shown in Figure 18, where a prograde satellite with mass 10% that of the
disk merges with a larger disk galaxy. As this massive satellite plunges 
through the disk, it scatters disk stars off their orbits, heating and 
thickening the stellar disk. As the satellite galaxy falls to the plane
of the disk through dynamical friction, conservation of total angular 
momentum dictates that the disk warp and tilt in response. The resulting
warped, thickened disk is qualitatively similar to those seen in some nearby
galaxies (such as NGC 3628) and inferred in our own Milky Way.

As a massive satellite spirals into the inner disk, it can also induce strong
spiral arms and bars through a resonant response in the disk. Interstellar
gas can be compressed along these features and flow inwards towards the 
nucleus due to gravitational torquing from the bar and arms, similar to, but
at a more modest level than, the major-merger induced nuclear inflows.
Thus these minor mergers can also drive increased disk and nuclear star 
formation rates, or activate of a central engine. When the merger
is complete, a significant fraction of the disk gas may have been swept from
the disk and into the nucleus. The disk itself has been kinematically heated,
and spiral structure destroyed by the passage of the companion through the
inner disk. The induced bar may buckle in three-dimensional space, scattering
stars above and below the disk plane, in a pseudo-bulge. The morphological,
kinematic, and star forming properties of the disk have all been radically
altered by this interaction, suggesting that even minor mergers can drive
significant evolution in disk galaxies.
